# Game Jam Template

This is the template for the 2025 Minestom Game Jam!

It is **not** mandatory to use this template - it's just here to help teams get working on the actual game first.

The template currently implements:
- Anvil world loading in `/lobby`
- Block handlers that send the correct NBT to the client
- A queue system

You can easily remove these if they're not desired; for example, to remove the queue, just delete Queue.java (and fix
the few related compiler errors).
